# Operating systems
This repo contais all of the sollution of my operating system module labs **+** the solution of the final test

## How it works ?
you will find the solutions organised in folders for each lab.

- to run the scripts you'll have to compile them first
```bash
$ make all
```

- `/bin`: here you'll find all the compiled files
- `exo.c`: here you'll find the source code
- `exo.txt`: here you'll find some documentations 



 

## Spotted any errors ?
if you spotted any errors you can solve them and rise a PR I will be happy to review it and add it to the original code
