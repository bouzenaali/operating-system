1. what happens during the execution of the following program ?
	- the program displays the content of the toto.txt file 
	- the program creates a child process and depending on the result of the fork() the program runs differntly
	- one process will display the first five characters and the other will print the next 

2. what happens if lines 10 and 11 are swapped ?
	- now the parent and the child will open the file separatly so they will both read the first five characters
